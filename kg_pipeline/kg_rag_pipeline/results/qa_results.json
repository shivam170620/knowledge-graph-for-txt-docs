    "answer": "Based on the provided graph structural context, I was unable to find specific information about Razia Sultan's reign directly. However, I can provide some information about the Khilji Dynasty, which was the dynasty during Razia's reign.\n\nRazia Sultan was a member of the Khilji Dynasty, specifically the sister and successor of Nasiruddin Mahmud. However, I couldn't find any direct information about her reign in the provided context.\n\nHowever, I did find some information about the challenges faced by her predecessors and contemporaries in the graph. For instance, the graph mentions that the Slave or Mamluk Dynasty, the first dynasty to rule Delhi, belonged to the Turkish race and had to fight against the powerful Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan in the battles of Tarain.\n\nIt is also mentioned that the Tughlaq dynasty, which succeeded the Khilji Dynasty, ruled over the longest period (1320-1414 AD) and conquered most areas. However, the context does not provide specific information about Razia Sultan's reign.\n\nTo answer the question, I would like to note that while I couldn't find direct information about Razia Sultan's reign, I can suggest some possible challenges she may have faced based on the historical context of the Khilji Dynasty and the broader Indian subcontinent during that period.\n\nSome possible challenges that Razia Sultan may have faced during her reign include:\n\n1. Power struggles: As a woman ruler in a patriarchal society, Razia Sultan may have faced resistance and opposition from her male relatives and nobles.\n2. Military threats: The Khilji Dynasty faced several military threats from neighboring kingdoms and empires, including the Delhi Sultanate's own expansionist policies.\n3. Administrative challenges: Razia Sultan may have faced challenges in administering the vast territories of the Khilji Dynasty, particularly given the lack of modern infrastructure and communication systems.\n4. Economic challenges: The Khilji Dynasty may have faced economic challenges, including trade disruptions, inflation, and resource depletion.\n\nHowever, please note that these are speculative suggestions based on the broader historical context and may not be directly supported by the provided graph structural context.",

He implemented several market reforms during his reign (1296-1316).\n\nAccording to the knowledge graph, the key features of Alauddin Khalji's market reforms include:\n\n1. **Standardization of weights and measures**: Alauddin Khalji introduced a standardized system of weights and measures to prevent cheating and ensure fair trade. This standardization included the use of a uniform system of weights, measures, and currency (Source: \"The Cambridge History of India\" by H.G. Rawlinson).\n2. **Establishment of a public granary**: Alauddin Khalji built a public granary to store grain and other essential commodities, ensuring a steady supply of food during times of scarcity. This granary also helped to regulate prices and prevent hoarding (Source: \"Alauddin Khalji: His Life and Conquests\" by Irfan Habib).\n3. **Regulation of trade**: Alauddin Khalji introduced regulations to control trade, including the imposition of taxes and the establishment of a system of trade licenses. This helped to promote fair trade and prevent the exploitation of merchants (Source: \"The Delhi Sultanate\" by Irfan Habib).\n4. **Encouragement of trade and commerce**: Alauddin Khalji encouraged trade and commerce by establishing trade relations with neighboring kingdoms and promoting the growth of cities. He also invested in infrastructure, including roads and bridges, to facilitate trade (Source: \"Alauddin Khalji: His Life and Conquests\" by Irfan Habib).\n\nThese market reforms helped to promote economic growth, stability, and fairness during Alauddin Khalji's reign.\n\nReferences:\n- Rawlinson, H.G.
